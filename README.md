# Frontend Developer Challenge #
In order to assess a candidate's development abilities, we offer the following challenge. 
Take as much time as you like but we recommend no more than 4 to 6 hours.

## Instructions ##
1. Fork the project.
2. Complete the project as described below within your fork.
3. Push all of your changes to your fork on github and submit a pull request.

## Project Description ##
One of our specializations at Idea Nerd is building web applications using AngularJS. As a consequence we tend to prefer application
architectures where the backend functions as an RESTful API server, aggregating and manipulating data, while the frontend focuses
on presenting data for the user. In lieu of a backend server you've been provided with some JSON files that can take the place
of API endpoints. The JSON files consist of business reviews and site members.

The Challenge:

1. Build a AngularJS-based local business rating application named Squeal that will allow the user to list the local business reviews
and their average rating.
2. A user should be able to drill into each business and view the reviews submitted by the site members for that business.
3. A user should also be able to drill into each user's profile and see the reviews the user has submitted.
